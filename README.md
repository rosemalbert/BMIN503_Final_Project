# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains the data files for Rose Albert's final project. The final report is "Albert_final_project.html" and "Albert_final_project.qmd".

The objective of this final project is to visualize county-level preterm birth rates using a publicly available dataset, CDC Wonder. This data is analyzed to interrogate the sex as a biological variable in preterm birth and NICU admission. 

This project was developed to complement Rose's thesis research which investigates molecular mechanisms underlying male vulnerability to early life lung injury. There is a well-established male vulnerability in the neonatal and pediatric developmental window, illustrating a significant need understand sex differences in development, disease, and response to therapeutics. This project takes a population health approach to assess sex differences in neonatal outcomes. Rose consulted with Dr. Heather Burris and Dr. Aimin Chen to discuss policy, practice, and research priorities toward perinatal equity.

Other files in this repository include: 
1. CDC_NatalityData.txt containing total population, total births, and birth rate data by county
2. Natality, 2016-2023 expanded_county.txt containing births and birth rate by county
3. Natality, 2016-2023 expanded_sex.txt containing the NICU admission, gestational age, and sex data by county
